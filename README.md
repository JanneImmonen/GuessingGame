# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game built with React Native and Expo. 

## About the Game

The player needs to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the game will inform the player if their guess was too low, too high, or correct. Once the player guesses the number correctly, they can reset the game and play again.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanneImmonen/GuessingGame.git
```

2. Go to the project directory:
